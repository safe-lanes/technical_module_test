Do not change anything except what is written below. Ask me first if anything is unclear.
Fix 1 — Component screen → Section C (Work Orders)

    W.O No. column must display the WO Template Code we defined:
    WO-<ComponentCode>-<TaskCode><FreqTag> (e.g., WO-6.1.1-INSM1, WO-1.1.1.2-OHRH1000).

        Bind this column to the field templateCode.

        If existing rows lack templateCode, compute once on load from saved fields (componentCode, basis, taskType, frequency) and persist.

    Row click opens the unified WO form, Part A (Work Order Details) for that template (edit mode).

    + Add WO opens the same unified WO form in add mode with the current component prefilled.

Fix 2 — Work Orders submodule (left sidebar → Work Orders)

    In the list table, replace Work Order No with the WO Template Code (bind to templateCode).

        Keep the human Job Title column unchanged.

        Existing filters/search must work with templateCode as well.

    Add W.O button must open the unified WO form, Part A (add mode).

        User selects Component (dropdown or picker) → auto-fill Component Code.

    The pencil/edit action opens the unified WO form, Part A for that template (edit mode).

    The clock/complete action opens Part B (Work Completion Record) for a new execution of the selected template.

Fix 3 — Form routing (single source of truth)

    There is one WO form used everywhere with two parts:

        Part A – Work Order Details (Template)

        Part B – Work Completion Record (Execution)

    Retire/redirect any legacy WO create/edit screens to this unified form.

Fix 4 — Codes & History (enforce)

    On save in Part A, ensure templateCode is generated/updated per rules and immutable unless basis/type/frequency changed.

    On submit in Part B, create Execution ID = <YYYY>-<templateCode>-<NN> and write to history; update template Next Due.

    Do not rename existing templates or executions.

Constraints

    No styling, color, or layout changes.

    No schema refactor beyond adding/filling templateCode (string) if missing.

    Do not touch other modules.
