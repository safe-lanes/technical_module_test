I'm struggling with the complexity of Module Federation setup for micro frontends. As a beginner, I need a simplified, automated solution to integrate our React crew appraisals system with our existing Angular 19 application.
Current Problem:

Complex webpack configurations causing errors
"Shared module eager consumption" errors
Too many manual steps for beginners
Need fallback when React app is down

What I Need:
1. Automated Setup Script
Please create a single setup script that:

Automatically configures Module Federation for Angular 19
Creates all necessary files (webpack.config.js, bootstrap.ts, main.ts)
Handles all the complex configurations automatically
No manual webpack editing required

2. Beginner-Friendly Angular Component
Create a simple Angular wrapper component that:

Automatically detects if React app is running
Loads React micro frontend if available
Shows fallback message if React app is down
Zero configuration needed - just drop and use

3. Fallback Support (Critical)
The Angular app must:

✅ Work normally when React app is down
✅ Continue running without any errors
✅ Show simple message when micro frontend unavailable
✅ Gracefully handle all connection failures

4. Simple Development Workflow
What I want as a developer:
bash# Step 1: Run your automated setup
npm run setup-microfrontend

# Step 2: Start Angular (works with or without React)
ng serve

# Step 3: Start React app (optional)
cd react-app && npm run dev
Technical Requirements:
Angular 19 Compatibility:

Angular 19.2.14
@angular-architects/module-federation@19.0.3
Handle all version conflicts automatically

Fallback Behavior:
typescript// What I want the component to do automatically:
if (reactAppAvailable) {
  // Load React micro frontend
  showReactApp();
} else {
  // Show fallback UI, Angular continues normally
  showFallbackMessage();
}
Error Handling:

No "eager consumption" errors
No webpack configuration errors
No build failures when React app is down
Silent fallback - no console errors

Deliverables Needed:

setup-microfrontend.js - Automated setup script
micro-frontend-wrapper.component.ts - Ready-to-use Angular component
webpack.config.js - Pre-configured, working webpack setup
README-MICROFRONTEND.md - Simple 3-step setup guide

Example Usage (What I Want):
bash# One-time setup
npm run setup-microfrontend

# In Angular app.module.ts - just import
import { MicroFrontendWrapperComponent } from './micro-frontend-wrapper.component';

# In template - just use
<app-micro-frontend-wrapper 
  remoteName="crewAppraisals"
  remoteUrl="http://localhost:5000/remoteEntry.js"
  fallbackMessage="Crew Appraisals temporarily unavailable">
</app-micro-frontend-wrapper>
Key Benefits for Beginners:
✅ One-command setup - No manual webpack editing
✅ Automatic fallback - Angular works with or without React
✅ Error-free - No complex debugging needed
✅ Plug-and-play - Just use the component
✅ Production-ready - Handles all edge cases
Current Pain Points to Solve:
❌ Complex webpack configurations
❌ Bootstrap pattern complexity
❌ Shared module errors
❌ Manual file creation
❌ No fallback when remote is down
Success Criteria:
A beginner should be able to:

Run one setup command
Use a simple Angular component
Have it work whether React app is running or not
Deploy to production without issues

Can you create this simplified, automated solution for Module Federation with Angular 19?
The goal is to make micro frontends accessible to beginners while maintaining production-quality reliability and fallback capabilities.
