1. Form Integration

    Reuse existing forms — The "Modify PMS" mode should load the exact same Components, Work Orders, Spares, and Stores forms that already exist in the system.

    No separate duplicate forms should be created; instead, these existing forms should have a "change request mode" toggle that:

        Sets the background to #52baf3.

        Enables change tracking (highlighting modified values in red).

        Disables direct save to PMS — instead, saving here creates a pending request.

2. Data Pre‑filling

    Yes, pre‑fill the form with the current PMS data from our existing modules (the same data a user would see if they opened that form in normal mode).

    The original PMS data stays untouched until the change request is approved.

    A separate Change Requests table should store:

        Original value (for comparison)

        New value (entered in request)

        Metadata (requester, date, category, status, comments, etc.)

3. User Permissions

    Implement a simple role‑based system now — minimum roles:

        Requestor (can create requests and view their own requests)

        Approver (Chief Engineer, Technical Superintendent — can approve/reject requests)

    You can simulate roles for now without a full login system, but structure the code so a proper login/role system can be plugged in later.

4. Visual Feedback

    Only the changed value text should turn red when modified, not the label.

    In review mode (when approver opens request), show original value (black/grey text) and new value (red text) side‑by‑side, or at least in a way that makes differences obvious.

    Example:

    Frequency: Frequency (Original) → 3 Months (New, Red)

5. Database Updates

    On approval:

        Update the corresponding PMS module (Components, Work Orders, Spares, or Stores) with the new values.

        Keep a permanent change log for audit purposes (store request ID, date, old values, new values, approver name).

    On rejection:

        Keep the request in the change log with status "Rejected".

        Do not update PMS data.

6. Comments System

    Keep it simple text comments for now — approver can type a comment before approving/rejecting.

    Store:

        Comment text

        User (who commented)

        Timestamp

    No need for threaded/multiple comments yet — just a single comment box per approval/rejection action.
