Components – Main View (Read-Only)

Purpose: One-screen view of a selected ship component: identity, health (running hours + condition metrics), open work, completed work, linked spares, documentation, class/regulatory linkage, and requisitions. Used by ship staff and office to assess status at a glance. This screen is read-only; edits happen elsewhere.
Global Layout & Navigation

    Top bar: Technical module selected. Quick access icons: Dashboard, Cert. & Surveys, Defects, PMS, Admin.

    Screen title: “Components”.

    Primary action (top-right): Add / Edit Component – opens the editable replica screen (not this view).

    Two-pane layout:

        Left pane: Component hierarchy and quick filters.

        Right pane: Details for the currently selected component, grouped into A–H collapsible sections.

Left Pane — Component Hierarchy & Filters

    Filters (chips): quick filters e.g., All, Critical items, All items (exact wording as in UI). Selecting a chip filters the tree/list.

    Search: “Search Components…” filters by name/code.

    Hierarchy tree: Numbered, collapsible groups (e.g., 1. Ship General, 2. Equipment for Cargo, 3. Machinery: Main Components → 3.1 Diesel Engines → 3.1.1 Main Engine, etc.).

    Selection behavior: Clicking any node loads that component’s details on the right. The selected node is highlighted.

Right Pane — Component Details (A–H)

    Header: Shows the selected node title (e.g., 1. Ship General).

    Sections: A through H are collapsible. Default is expanded A, others collapsed. All data is display-only.
