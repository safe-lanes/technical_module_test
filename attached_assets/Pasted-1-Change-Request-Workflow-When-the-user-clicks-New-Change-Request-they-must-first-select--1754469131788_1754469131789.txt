1. Change Request Workflow

    When the user clicks "New Change Request", they must first select a category from the left sidebar (Components, Work Orders, Spares, Stores).

    Based on the selected category, the system will open the exact same existing form for that category (with all the same fields, layout, dropdowns, and data as in the original PMS forms).

    In this special "Modify PMS" mode:

        All form fields will have a background color #52baf3 so the user knows they are editing in change‑request mode.

        The form will be pre‑filled with the current data from the PMS.

    As soon as the user changes any field value, the changed field should immediately display the new value in red text (while keeping the background #52baf3).

    The user can make multiple changes and then click "Save" to submit the request.

2. Approval Process

    Every change request created will be stored with a status: Pending Approval, Approved, or Rejected.

    Only designated users (e.g., Chief Engineer, Technical Superintendent) should have the rights to approve or reject a request.

    Approval workflow:

        Approver clicks the change request from the right panel list.

        The form opens in review mode, showing:

            Original values (in normal text color)

            Changed values highlighted in red text so the approver can quickly spot edits.

        Approver can either Approve (change is applied to PMS) or Reject (change is discarded).

        A comments box should be available for approvers to give reasons for rejection or notes for approval.

3. Category Filtering

    The left panel category list (Components, Work Orders, Spares, Stores) should filter the right‑hand request list so only requests from that category are shown.

    By default, all categories can be shown if no specific category is selected.

4. Request Details

    Clicking on a request title should open the full change request form in review mode.

    This view should display:

        All original data (default PMS values)

        All modified fields in red text

        Any comments added by the requester

        Status of the request (Pending/Approved/Rejected)

        Requester’s name, date of submission

5. Actions for Each Request

    For request creators:

        View details

        Cancel/Delete request (only if still pending)

    For approvers:

        View details

        Approve

        Reject (with comment)

6. Status Management

    Status changes should only be made via the approval/rejection buttons — no direct manual status editing.

    Once approved, the PMS database should automatically update with the new values.

    Once rejected, the change is logged but does not alter the PMS database.
