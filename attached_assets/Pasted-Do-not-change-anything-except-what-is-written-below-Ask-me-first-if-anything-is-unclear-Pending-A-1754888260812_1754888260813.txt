Do not change anything except what is written below. Ask me first if anything is unclear.
Pending Approval → Approve/Reject flow (Work Order Execution)
1) Entry condition

    When a Work Order is opened from the “Pending Approval” tab, load the same unified WO form (execution view), but:

        All fields remain read-only (as currently in Pending Approval).

        Show two buttons at the bottom: Approve and Reject.

        Show a “Rejection Comments” textarea beneath the buttons (hidden/collapsed until Reject is clicked OR always visible—choose simplest to implement).

        No other UI/UX changes.

2) Approve action

    Click Approve → confirm dialog: “Approve this work completion?”

    On confirm:

        Set execution Status = Approved.

        Move this execution to the Completed tab.

        Write/ensure the record appears in the component’s Section D – Maintenance History.

        Reset the maintenance cycle on the template:

            If Calendar-based → Next Due Date = Completion Date + Frequency.

            If Running-Hours-based → Next Due Reading = Completion Reading + Frequency.

        Persist an audit log: approver id, timestamp, action = Approve.

        Close the form and toast: “Work Order approved.”

        Do not change any other form fields or styles.

3) Reject action

    Click Reject → if Rejection Comments is empty, block with message: “Please enter rejection comments.”

    On confirm:

        Set execution Status = Rejected.

        Return the execution to the submitter’s queue and show it under All W.O (not in Completed, not in Pending Approval).

        Do not reset the template’s maintenance cycle (no change to Next Due Date/Reading).

        Persist an audit log: approver id, timestamp, action = Reject, comments.

        Close the form and toast: “Work Order rejected.”

4) Tab behavior recap (no visual changes)

    Pending Approval: shows executions with Status = Pending Approval. Row click opens this read-only approval form with Approve/Reject.

    Completed: shows executions with Status = Approved.

    All W.O: shows templates; also include Rejected executions until resubmitted, per existing list pattern.

    Due/Overdue: unchanged (template-level).

5) Constraints & routing

    Keep all existing layouts, colors, spacing, and columns unchanged.

    Use existing unified WO form; this change is conditional rendering only when opened from Pending Approval.

    Do not modify other modules or routes.

    Preserve all data; no schema refactor beyond fields already used (status, approver, approverRemarks, timestamps).

6) Notifications (optional if already available)

    If a notification system exists, notify the submitter on approve/reject with the approver’s remarks. No new UI for this.
