Do not change anything except what is written below. Ask me first if anything is unclear.
Fix header + new vs existing behavior on Add/Edit Component screen

    Header (top of right pane)

    Replace the current “601.003.XXX” box with:

        Component Name: editable text input (required).

        Component Code: read-only label shown under the name (small, muted). This is auto-filled from the tree path per our path-code rules.

    Section defaults by mode

    Add (new component):

        Section C – Work Orders: start empty (no rows). Keep the + Add WO button.

            When adding a WO, include fields: WO Title, Assigned To, Frequency Type (dropdown: Running Hours, Calendar), Frequency Value (number), Initial Next Due (optional date). Store as given; do not auto-schedule anything else yet.

        Section D – Maintenance History: start empty. Keep the + Add M History button.

    Edit (existing component):

        Load all saved data for A–H as-is (including any WOs and History).

    Tree + selection

    Use the same tree (data, labels, numbering) as the Components screen.

    Click node → Edit that component (load all sections).

    Select parent → Add Sub Component → Add mode under that parent.

    Component Code remains read-only and always equals the node’s path (e.g., 6.1.1, 1.1.1.2).

    Auto code + validation (unchanged rules)

    On Add: code = parent.path + "." + nextIntegerAtThatLevel (no leading zeros; allow 10, 11, …).

    On Move/Re-parent: recompute full path code.

    On Save: block if code ≠ computed path or not unique within vessel. Message: “Component Code must match tree position.”

    A–H sections are customizable

    Initially render the form exactly like the read-only view (same fields, order).

    Keep existing ability to add/delete fields inside any section and add/delete rows where applicable.

    Do not change styling, spacing, or colors.

    Do not touch anything else (routes, other screens, models, styles).
