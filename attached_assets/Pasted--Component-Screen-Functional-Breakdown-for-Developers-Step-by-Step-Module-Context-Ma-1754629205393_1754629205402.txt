🔧 Component Screen – Functional Breakdown for Developers (Step-by-Step)
✅ Module Context

    Main Module: Technical

    Submodule: PMS (Planned Maintenance System)

    Sub-submodule: Components

    Screen Name: Component Register / Component View

This screen is the central dashboard for viewing all technical components onboard a vessel and their associated maintenance, spare parts, class certification, and regulatory linkage. It is used by ship staff and office users to view and assess the status of any machinery or system onboard.
🧱 SCREEN STRUCTURE
1️⃣ Left Pane: Component Hierarchy Tree
📌 Purpose:

Displays a collapsible hierarchical structure of all shipboard components.
📌 Design:

    Hierarchical (Tree View) layout

    Based on department > equipment group > sub-component

    Resembles a file explorer (parent-child nodes)

    Data typically sourced from SFI Codes or customized hierarchy uploads

📌 Functionality:

    Clicking a node on the tree loads that component’s details on the right pane

    Example hierarchy:

            Ship General

            Equipment for Cargo

            Machinery: Main Components

            3.1 Diesel Engines

                3.1.1 Main Engine

                    3.1.1.1 Main Bearings

                    3.1.1.2 Cylinder Liners

📌 Notes for Devs:

    Use dummy data for hierarchy for now.

    Final data will come via Excel upload through Admin Module.

    Node names, codes, and relationships will reflect real ship equipment structure.

2️⃣ Right Pane: Component Details View
📌 Purpose:

Shows all relevant data of the selected component in clean, collapsible sections.
📌 Layout:

Sections labeled A to H, each collapsible (> toggle). Display only (read-only screen).

✅ Final Remarks for Devs

    This screen is read-only. No editing functionality at this stage.

    Each section is fully collapsible with clean spacing.

    All data is dummy for now — integrate later via API or backend DB.

    Maintain full consistency in card layout, padding, font, and color coding with existing PMS screens.
