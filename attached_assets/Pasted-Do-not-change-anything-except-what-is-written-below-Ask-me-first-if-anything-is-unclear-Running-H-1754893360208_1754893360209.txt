Do not change anything except what is written below. Ask me first if anything is unclear.
Running Hours — roll back UI, restore data, add utilization rate safely
A) Restore previous UI exactly

    Revert filters to the last working set and order (whatever was live before this change).

        Do not add any new filters.

        Default states must not filter anything (show all components).

    Keep existing buttons as before (Bulk Update RH, Export, Clear).

    Table columns must be exactly as before, except: replace “Tracking” with “Utilization Rate” (same column position).

    No CSS/layout changes; remove any loaders that block rows from rendering after data arrives.

B) Fix empty list regression

    On screen load, fetch the same dataset as before (use the previous query/service).

    Never gate table rendering on utilization-rate computation. Rows must render as soon as component data loads.

    If any filter is active, show a small non-blocking “No results” state with a Reset link—do not show a blank table when data exists.

    Ensure the data query uses LEFT JOIN (or equivalent) so components without RH audit still appear (RH = 0, Utilization = —).

    Pagination should match the previous behavior (counts and page numbers identical to pre-change).

C) Utilization Rate (safe, async)

    Compute Utilization Rate (hrs/day) asynchronously after rows render:

        Window: last 30 days of RH audit; use cumulativeRH.

        If <2 points → show —.

        utilization = max( (end - start) / max(days,1), 0 ), 1 decimal.

    Cache per component in memory for 15 min; bust cache on any RH save.

    Do not let missing/corrupt audit data hide the row or block the table.

D) Keep the three approved features only

    Add Δ vs Set Total toggle in both single + bulk dialogs (logic unchanged from prior spec).

    Back-dated entries allowed; future dates blocked; always write an audit row.

    Meter replaced? per-row (bulk & single) with cumulative handling.

    No other logic changes in this module.

E) Acceptance checks (must pass)

    Load screen with sample data → all previous components are visible; only one new column (“Utilization Rate”).

    Changing no filters shows full list; clicking Clear returns to full list.

    Turning off network for Utilization calculation still shows rows; only the Utilization cells stay —.

    Bulk/Single RH save updates totals and leaves UI intact.

If anything in the current codebase prevents restoring the last working query/UI, pause and ask before proceeding.
