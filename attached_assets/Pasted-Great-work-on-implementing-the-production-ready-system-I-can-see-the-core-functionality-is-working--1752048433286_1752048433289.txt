Great work on implementing the production-ready system! I can see the core functionality is working. I have a few questions to ensure everything is complete:
Database Connection & Setup:
MySQL Database Location: You mentioned implementing MySQL integration, but I didn't provide any MySQL connection details. Where exactly is the MySQL database created? Is it using a local instance, a cloud service, or still running in-memory?
Connection String: What MySQL connection string is the app currently using? Do I need to set up my own MySQL database and provide connection details?
Database Setup: Are there specific MySQL setup steps I need to follow, or is it automatically configured?
Database & Data Management:4. Sample Data: I see the interface is working, but are there sample crew members and appraisal data already seeded in the database for testing? 5. Form Submission: When I fill out and submit an appraisal form, does it actually save to the MySQL database and reflect in the crew list? 6. Database Schema: Can you confirm all the MySQL tables are properly created and the relationships are working correctly?
Enhanced Features I Notice:7. Advanced Visualizations: I see mentions of "Animated rating visualizations," "Interactive performance trend graphs," and "PDF export" - are these features fully implemented or are they planned enhancements? 8. Gamification Badges: Are the "gamification badges for top-performing crew members" actually functional?
Production Readiness:9. Environment Configuration: Can you provide the complete setup instructions for MySQL configuration and environment variables? 10. Data Persistence: If I restart the application, will all the data (crew members, appraisals, form configurations) persist correctly? 11. API Testing: Are there any API endpoints I should test to verify the MySQL integration is working properly?
Micro Frontend Compatibility:12. Module Federation: Is the micro frontend setup still intact after these changes, so I can integrate it with my Angular app later?
Could you confirm these points and clarify the MySQL database setup process?
